Vector

This program is my implementation of the vector class. It is able to store a list of ints and has in-build functionality to handle increasing the number of elements in the list.

Tests:
The tests outlined in the main.cpp file include a way to stress test the amount of elements can be put into a vector aswell as test diferent methods such as pushback, size, the assignment operator, the [], and the copy constructor.
